# **MAC-Address-Generator**
A simple program to generate MAC addresses

## For Linux
Open Terminal  
Navigate Terminal to the directory where the script is saved  
Type ```python3 mac_addr_generator.py```

## For Windows
Open Powershell  
Navigate Powershell to the directory where the script is saved  
Type ```.\mac_addr_generator.py```  
**Please note that double clicking on the file _will not_ allow you to see the generated MAC address, so Powershell is needed to run the script correctly**
